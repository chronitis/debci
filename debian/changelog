debci (0.5.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add missing dctrl-tools dependency.
  * Use "dpkg --print-architecture" instead of dpkg-architecture, to avoid a
    dependency on dpkg-dev and the (undeclared) dependency on gcc.
  * Fix grep_packages() to actually use the configured architecture instead of
    the host architecture.
  * Add --help output to debci-{list-packages,setup,test}, instead of failing
    with an "usage: not found" error.

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * Initial upload to Debian (Closes: #736416)
    The API is not set yet, but I am uploading anyway to allow for early
    testing, improve contribution opportunities, to get a BTS etc.
  * Updated documentation
    - instructions for setting up a development instance.
    - Point traffic at debian-qa
  * modularize behaviour of a backend
    - existing implementation extracted as the `schroot` backend
    - added a `fake` backend that helps with testing
  * schroot backend optimization: always run with eatmydata
  * Add blame support: when tests of a package start failing after some
    dependencies were updated, those dependencies will be "blamed" for the
    failure.
  * improvements on autopkgtest usage:
    - debci now uses the autopkgtest support for downloading the source
      package instead of downloading manually and them calling adt-run
    - debci now differentiates between the non-zero adt-run exit codes, so
      that skipped tests will not count as failures. Also added a `tmpfail`
      status, to be used when for some reason the tests could not be run for
      some external failure (e.g. mirror failures, broken dependencies etc).
  * debci now keeps track of the base system. Tests will be run again every 2
    weeks even if no explicit dependency changes. Test logs will also display
    the changes in the base system since the last run.
  * Add DEP-8 support to debci itself \o/
  * extra safety: add `set -u` to all shell scripts

debci (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Package renamed to debci
  * Require a newer autopkgtest.
    - In general we should always be using a backport of the most recent
      version in unstable.
  * Visual facelift
    - embedding a copy of bootstrap 3 for now :-(
  * Add backend support for multiple architectures. For now unstable/amd64 is
    hardcoded, but reading them from the command line or from the environment
    will not require a large change.
