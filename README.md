# Debian Continuous Integration

The [Debian continuous integration](..) (debci) is an automated system that
coordinates the execution of automated tests against packages in the
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/) system. `debci` will continuously run
`autopkgtest` test suites from source packages in the Debian archive.

## Documentation for package maintainers

The {file:MAINTAINERS.md FAQ for package maintainers} contains useful
information on how to declare the test suite, how the test is executed,
how to reproduce the test runs locally, etc.

## Deployment

See the {file:INSTALL.md installation guide} for instructions on how to deploy
debci to your own infrastructure.

## Reporting Bugs

Please report bugs against the [debci package](https://bugs.debian.org/debci)
in the [Debian BTS](http://bugs.debian.org/).
